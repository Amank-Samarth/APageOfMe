## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
In the modern recruitment landscape, the process of shortlisting candidates often begins with resume screening. Traditionally, this task is manual, time-consuming, and prone to human bias and error. With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, there is an increasing demand for intelligent systems that can analyze resumes efficiently and objectively, providing not only a score but also personalized recommendations for career advancement. The Smart Resume Analyser App is designed to address these challenges by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and web technologies to automate resume analysis and provide actionable guidance to job seekers.

### 1.2 Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project stems from the need to bridge the gap between job seekers and recruiters by offering an unbiased, data-driven evaluation of resumes. Many candidates are unaware of how their resumes are perceived by automated systems or recruiters. By providing comprehensive analysis and feedback, the Smart Resume Analyser App empowers users to improve their employability and make informed career decisions.

### 1.3 Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to create a robust, user-friendly platform that not only analyzes resumes but also offers a holistic suite of career development tools, including skill and course recommendations, resume writing tips, and career guidance. The application aims to be a one-stop solution for both job seekers and administrators, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the recruitment process.
